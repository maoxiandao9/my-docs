Don't confuse with the <em>Wi-Fi channels</em>.)</li>\n<li> is the number of bits per I/Q sample.  can be two values:\n<ul>\n<li>32-bit: Most USRPs use 16-bit I/Q wire-transfer format, i.e., 2 bytes for I and 2 bytes for Q;</li>\n<li>16-bit: N2x0 also supports 8-bit I/Q wire-transfer format, however, this degrades the signal quality.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The N2x0's master clock rate (MCR) is 100 MHz, however, sampling at 100 MHz sampling rate requires: , which is far beyond the capacity of a 1GbE connection.</li>\n<li>The X3x0's MCR is 200 MHz, thus sampling the two channels at 200 MHz requires: . This is beyond the capacity of a single 10GbE connection, which is why the X3x0 adopts dual-SFP+ for dual-10GbE connections.</li>\n<li>The X410's maximum MCR is 500 MHz (with <code>CG_400</code> FPGA image). The maximum bandwidth requirement for sampling 4 channels would be: . This massive bandwidth requirement explains why the X410 utilizes high-speed 100GbE connections to handle the data throughput.</li>\n<li>In contrast, the HackRF One has a maximum sampling rate of 20 MHz and uses 8-bit I/Q transfer format (16 bits per sample): . This bandwidth requirement is well within the capacity of USB 2.0 (480 Mbps), which explains why HackRF One can operate effectively with a USB 2.0 connection.</li>\n</ul>\n<h2>NI USRP B2x0</h2>\n<p>All B2x0 series devices are connected using a <strong>USB 3.0 cable</strong>. It is important to note that USB 3.0 cables can be identified by their <em>blue-colored \"tongue\"</em> and the presence of <em>five additional contacts inside the connector</em> compared to USB 2.0.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">USB 3.0 cable for connecting NI USRP B2x0 devices</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hint-container tip\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Tips</p>\n<p>The USB 3.0 connection significantly limits the B2x0's maximum sampling rate, specifically to 28 MHz sampling rate for two channels, or 56 MHz for a single channel. To fully utilize the performance of the AD9361 frontend, consider the <a href=\"#ni-usrp-e320\">NI USRP E320</a>, which avoids this limitation with a 10GbE connection.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>NI USRP N2x0</h2>\n<p>The NI USRP N2x0 utilizes a <strong>1GbE Ethernet</strong> port for connectivity with the host computer. Simply use a Cat 6 Ethernet cable to connect the RJ45 ports of both the N2x0 and your host computer.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">Cat 6 Ethernet Cable for connecting NI USRP N2x0 devices</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hint-container info\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Info</p>\n<p>As described in <a href=\"#bandwidth-requirement-for-signal-streaming\">Bandwidth Computation</a>, the 1GbE connection significantly limits the N2x0's maximum sampling rate, specifically to 25 MHz with 16-bit wire-transfer format, or 50 MHz with 8-bit format.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>NI USRP X3x0 series</h2>\n<p>The NI USRP X3x0 series devices (X300 and X310) use <strong>dual-SFP+ interfaces</strong> for signal streaming, supporting up to <strong>dual-10GbE</strong> connection with <code>XG</code> firmware. With this dual-10GbE connection, the X3x0 can transmit and receive I/Q streams from dual channels with up to 200 MSPS rate.</p>\n<p>The following is our recommended connection solution based on our long-term practice, balancing performance, reliability, and low risk of physical damage.</p>\n<h3>Cable &amp; Connector for 10GbE Connection</h3>\n<p><strong>SFP+ DAC (Direct Attach Copper) Cable</strong> is our preferred choice. It features integrated SFP+ connectors on both ends, which enhances robustness and minimizes the risk of physical damage. It is both cost-effective and highly reliable. Additionally, since the SFP+ connectors are directly attached to the cable, you don't need to worry about losing adapters.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">SFP+ DAC cable is recommended for connecting NI USRP X3x0 devices</p>\n</div>\n<p>Alternatives (not recommended):</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>RJ45 Cable + Dual SFP+ to RJ45 Adapters</strong>: This setup allows the use of standard Ethernet cables with SFP+ ports but tends to be more expensive. The adapters are separate components that need to be kept track of, and improper use of RJ45 adapters can damage the SFP+ interfaces.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Separate Optical Cable and SFP+ Optical Transceivers</strong>: This option involves using individual optical cables and SFP+ optical transceivers at each end. It allows for significantly longer connection distances without compromising signal quality. However, it is more expensive and requires careful handling of the optical cables to avoid physical damage. There is also a risk of misplacing the adapters.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>SFP+ AOC Cable</strong>: Similar to the DAC cable, the SFP+ AOC (Active Optical Cable) incorporates fiber optics, which makes it more costly and more prone to physical damage.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>10GbE NIC Solution</h3>\n<h4>Quad-10GbE Connectivity for Desktop Computer</h4>\n<p>For desktop computers, we strongly recommend the <strong>Intel X710-DA4 Quad-Port 10GbE</strong> Ethernet NIC. Unlike cheaper single or dual-port 10GbE NICs that limit you to a single USRP device, this quad-port NIC enables true multi-USRP operation. We have tested it to simultaneously operate two USRP X3x0 devices (or a single X410 device), supporting clock-synchronized four channels with a 200 MSPS rate (250 MSPS for the X410) for both transmission and reception. The system achieves impressive peak throughput rates of up to 2 GB/s for both sending and receiving data, making it significantly more capable than basic single/dual-10GbE NICs.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">Intel X710-DA4 Quad-Port 10GbE NIC for desktop computers</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Single 10GbE Connectivity for Laptop with Thunderbolt 3+ Port</h4>\n<p>For laptops equipped with Thunderbolt 3+ ports, we utilize the <strong>QNAP QNA-T310G1S Thunderbolt 3 to 10GbE SFP+</strong> NIC. This NIC has been tested to operate one USRP X3x0 device (or a single X410 device), supporting one channel with a 200 MSPS rate (250 MSPS for the X410) for both transmission and reception. The system can achieve peak throughput rates of up to 480 MB/s for both sending and receiving data.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">QNAP QNA-T310G1S adapter for Thunderbolt 3+ laptops</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hint-container warning\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Warning</p>\n<p>We have tested that you CANNOT achieve dual-10GbE streaming by just using two such adapters.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Dual 10GbE Connectivity for Laptop with Thunderbolt 3+ Port</h4>\n<p>The <strong>Sonnet Twin10G SFP28 Thunderbolt Adapter</strong> is a <em>possible</em> solution. This adapter provides two SFP+ ports through a single Thunderbolt connection, potentially enabling the operation of a dual-channel USRP X3x0 device at full capacity.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">Sonnet Twin10G SFP28 Thunderbolt Adapter for dual 10GbE connections</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hint-container info\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Info</p>\n<p>We do NOT test this solution ourselves. If you have successfully achieved dual-10GbE streaming using this device, please let us know and we will update this page.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Single 10GbE Connectivity for Laptop without Thunderbolt 3+ Port</h4>\n<p>For laptops without Thunderbolt 3+ ports, an <strong>M.2-to-10GbE adapter</strong> is perhaps the last available solution. However, this approach has serious limitations:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>M.2 Slot Usage</strong>: Requires one M.2 slot, typically used for SSD storage</li>\n<li><strong>Physical Risk</strong>: Cannot properly close the laptop's back panel, risking physical damage</li>\n</ol>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">M.2-to-10GbE adapter - use with caution</p>\n</div>\n<div class=\"hint-container warning\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Warning</p>\n<p>We do NOT test this solution ourselves. For serious USRP-based research and development, we strongly recommend using either a desktop computer or a laptop with Thunderbolt 3+ ports. However, if you have successfully implemented this solution, please let us know and we will update this page.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>1GbE Mode: Severely Limited Performance</h3>\n<p>The 1GbE mode (SFP+ Port 0 under <code>HG</code> firmware), which comes enabled by default for initial hardware setup purposes, severely restricts data streaming capabilities. As detailed in the <a href=\"#bandwidth-requirement-for-signal-streaming\">Network Bandwidth Calculation</a>, this mode only supports a single channel with sampling rates below 25 MSPS - <strong>far below the device's full potential</strong>. Due to these significant bandwidth limitations, 1GbE mode should never be used for serious research or development work. It should only be utilized during initial device setup and basic connectivity testing.</p>\n<h3>PCIe Interface? Not Recommended!</h3>\n<p>Besides Ethernet connectivity, the NI USRP X3x0 series also provides a direct PCIe connection option through the \"PCIe Connectivity Kit\". However, we strongly advise <strong>AGAINST</strong> using this solution. The PCIe cable and host-side card are prohibitively expensive, and most importantly, <strong>this interface does NOT support multi-USRP combination</strong>.</p>\n<h2>NI USRP N3xx Series</h2>\n<h3>N300 and N310</h3>\n<p>The N300 and N310 models feature the same <strong>dual-SFP+ interfaces</strong> as the X3x0 for signal streaming, supporting up to <strong>dual-10GbE</strong> connections. For details, refer to the <a href=\"#ni-usrp-x3x0-series\">NI USRP X3x0 section</a>.</p>\n<h3>N320 and N321</h3>\n<p>The N320 and N321 models feature <strong>dual-SFP+ interfaces</strong> and an additional <strong>QSFP+ interface</strong>. For dual-SFP+ interfaces, refer to the <a href=\"#ni-usrp-x3x0-series\">NI USRP X3x0 section</a>. Regardless of the connection type used, it is necessary to flash the <code>XG</code> firmware to achieve dual-10GbE connections.</p>\n<h4>QSFP+ based Connectivity</h4>\n<p>Although the QSFP+ interface (literally quad-lane SFP+) supports 4  10GbE, the N320 and N321 models only utilize two lanes, making it equivalent to a dual-10GbE connection.</p>\n<p>We use a <strong>QSFP+ to 4x SFP+ Breakout Cable</strong> to connect N320 and N321 to the <a href=\"#quad-10gbe-connectivity-for-desktop-computer\">host-side Intel X710 NIC</a>.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">QSFP+ to 4x SFP+ Breakout Cable for connecting NI USRP N320 and N321</p>\n</div>\n<h3>MPM Architecture</h3>\n<p>The N3xx utilizes the MPM (Modular Peripheral Manager) architecture. For details on properly using its high-speed SFP+/QSFP+ ports, RJ45 port, and USB Console JTAG port, please refer to the <a href=\"#commons-of-mpm-architecture-devices-e320n3xxx4xx\">Commons of MPM Architecture Devices</a> section.</p>\n<h2>NI USRP E320</h2>\n<p>The E320 model utilizes a single <strong>SFP+ interface</strong> for signal streaming, supporting up to <strong>10GbE</strong> connection. This setup aligns with the connectivity approach used for the X3x0 model. For details, refer to the <a href=\"#ni-usrp-x3x0-series\">NI USRP X3x0 section</a>.</p>\n<p>The E320 utilizes the MPM (Modular Peripheral Manager) architecture. For details on properly using its high-speed 10GbE port, RJ45 port, and USB Console JTAG port, please refer to the <a href=\"#commons-of-mpm-architecture-devices-e320n3xxx4xx\">Commons of MPM Architecture Devices</a> section.</p>\n<h2>NI USRP X4xx Series</h2>\n<p>The X4xx series devices, X410 and X440, are equipped with <strong>dual QSFP28 interfaces</strong>, supporting up to <strong>dual-100GbE</strong> connections. When paired with the <code>CG_400</code> firmware, the X410 supports simultaneous 500 MSPS Tx and Rx across four channels. When paired with the <code>CG_1600</code> firmware, the X440 supports up to 2 GSPS Tx and Rx on a single channel.</p>\n<h3>Host-Side Ethernet Solutions</h3>\n<p>We provide two proven solutions for connecting X4xx devices, each suited for different performance requirements.</p>\n<h4>Solution 1: Dual-100GbE Connection for Desktop (Recommended)</h4>\n<p>Our recommended solution utilizes the <strong>Mellanox/NVIDIA ConnectX-5 EX (MCX516A-CDAT)</strong> NIC. This dual-port QSFP28 card supports both 40GbE and 100GbE modes through its PCIe Gen4 x16 interface, offering maximum performance and future-proofing capabilities. This NIC has been <em>officially tested by NI to achieve the maximum performance</em> claimed by X4xx devices.</p>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">Mellanox/NVIDIA ConnectX-5 EX dual-port 100GbE NIC</p>\n</div>\n<p>For connectivity, we recommend using <strong>QSFP28 DAC cables</strong>. The number of cables needed depends on your FPGA image, See <a href=\"#choose-fpga-image\">Choose FPGA Image</a>.</p>\n<div class=\"hint-container info\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Info</p>\n<p>Solution 1 is recommended for high-performance applications but is exclusive to X4xx devices.</p>\n</div>\n<div style=\"text-align: center; margin: 20px 0;\">\n  \n  <p style=\"font-style: italic; margin-top: 10px;\">QSFP28 DAC cable for 100GbE connections</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Solution 2: Quad-10GbE Connection for Desktop</h4>\n<p>We reuse the <a href=\"#quad-10gbe-connectivity-for-desktop-computer\"><strong>Intel X710-DA4 Quad-Port 10GbE</strong></a> NIC for this solution. This approach is particularly valuable for working with multiple USRP generations, as the same NIC can be used with X3x0 and N3x0 devices. The connection requires a <a href=\"#qsfp-based-connectivity\"><strong>QSFP+ to 4x SFP+ breakout cable</strong></a>, which connects the X4xx's QSFP28 Port 0 (operating in 40GbE with <code>X4_200</code> FPGA image) to the NIC's four SFP+ ports.</p>\n<div class=\"hint-container info\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Info</p>\n<p>Although limited to 250 MSPS per channel, Solution 2 is more convenient for working with other USRP models, like E320, X3x0 and N3xx.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Solution 3: Single/Dual-10GbE Connection for Laptop</h4>\n<p>For laptops with Thunderbolt 3+ ports, we recommend using the same solutions as described in the <a href=\"#ni-usrp-x3x0-series\">NI USRP X3x0 section</a>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Single 10GbE Connection</strong>: Use the <a href=\"#single-10gbe-connectivity-for-laptop-with-thunderbolt-3-port\"><strong>QNAP QNA-T310G1S Thunderbolt 3 to 10GbE SFP+</strong></a> NIC. This setup supports one channel with a 250 MSPS rate (with <code>X4_200</code> FPGA image) for both transmission and reception.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Dual 10GbE Connection</strong>: The <a href=\"#dual-10gbe-connectivity-for-laptop-with-thunderbolt-3-port\"><strong>Sonnet Twin10G SFP28 Thunderbolt Adapter</strong></a> is a <em>possible</em> solution for dual-channel operation. However, we have not tested this configuration ourselves.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"hint-container warning\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Warning</p>\n<p>For laptops without Thunderbolt 3+ ports, we strongly recommend using a desktop computer instead of attempting to use M.2-to-10GbE adapters. The performance limitations and physical risks associated with M.2 adapters make them unsuitable for serious USRP development.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>Choose FPGA Image</h3>\n<p>The choice of FPGA image determines both the device's capabilities and its network requirements:</p>\n<p>The standard performance images (<code>UC_200</code> and <code>X4_200</code>) support sampling rates up to 250 MSPS per channel. These images enable the built-in DUC/DDC (Digital Up/Down Conversion), allowing devices to operate at multiple sampling rates: 250, 125, 83.333, 62.5, 50, 25 MHz, etc. Note that <code>UC_200</code> works exclusively with Solution 1, while <code>X4_200</code> only works with Solution 2.</p>\n<p>The high-performance images (<code>CG_400</code> and <code>CG_1600</code>) require Solution 1's dual-100GbE connectivity to achieve maximum hardware capabilities. The <code>CG_400</code> enables impressive 500 MSPS operation across all four channels on the X410, while the <code>CG_1600</code> pushes the X440 to its limits with up to 2 GSPS on a single channel. However, to achieve these peak performance levels, these images bypass the DUC/DDC (Digital Up/Down Conversion) functionality. As a result, unlike the <code>UC_200</code>/<code>X4_200</code> images that offer flexible sampling rate options, devices running high-performance images can only operate at their maximum sampling rates.</p>\n<div class=\"hint-container warning\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Warning</p>\n<p>High-performance images place extreme computational demands on the host computer. Using them indiscriminately will lead to severe performance bottlenecks. Only use <code>CG_400</code> or <code>CG_1600</code> images when sampling rates above 250 MSPS are <em>truly needed</em> for your application.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>MPM Architecture</h3>\n<p>The X4xx utilizes the MPM (Modular Peripheral Manager) architecture. For details on properly using its high-speed QSFP28+ ports, RJ45 port, and USB Console JTAG port, please refer to the <a href=\"#commons-of-mpm-architecture-devices-e320n3xxx4xx\">Commons of MPM Architecture Devices</a> section.</p>\n<h2>Commons of MPM Architecture Devices (E320/N3xx/X4xx)</h2>\n<p>The E320, N3xx, and X4xx series devices employ an advanced architecture known as the Modular Peripheral Manager (MPM). This architecture integrates two key components:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Processing System (PS)</strong>: An ARM-based Linux system that handles device management, configuration, and control</li>\n<li><strong>Programmable Logic (PL)</strong>: An FPGA that processes the I/Q signals and handles high-speed data streaming</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This dual-system design provides robust device management capabilities while maintaining high-performance signal processing. However, it also introduces some important considerations regarding device connectivity and management.</p>\n<h3>RJ45 Port: Only for Management and Connectivity Test</h3>\n<p>The RJ45 port provides direct access to the embedded Linux system (PS), enabling users to perform essential device management tasks such as firmware updates, network configuration, system monitoring, and initial setup verification.</p>\n<p>While this port can technically handle signal streaming, we <strong>strongly recommend against using it for data transmission</strong> for several critical reasons:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bandwidth Constraints</strong>: The 1GbE RJ45 connection significantly limits throughput, preventing the device from reaching its full potential</li>\n<li><strong>Increased Latency</strong>: Data must traverse through the Linux system (PS) before reaching the FPGA (PL), adding substantial processing delays</li>\n<li><strong>Degraded Performance</strong>: The data path between PS and PL creates performance bottlenecks, leading to timing inconsistencies and reduced data rates</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>USB Console JTAG: Emergency Recovery Interface</h3>\n<p>The USB Console JTAG port enables <strong>direct serial communication with the embedded Linux system</strong>. While users typically interact with the device via SSH over Ethernet during normal operation, this port serves as a <strong>critical recovery mechanism</strong> in situations where SSH connectivity becomes unavailable.</p>\n<h3>DANGER: Never Use SFP+/QSFP+/QSFP28+ for Device Management!</h3>\n<p><strong>Never attempt device management operations through SFP+/QSFP+/QSFP28+ ports</strong>. These high-speed interfaces are designed exclusively for signal streaming, and using them for device management tasks can lead to serious consequences including abrupt connection termination, failed updates, device bricking, or permanent hardware damage. For all device management operations, <strong>always use the dedicated RJ45 port or USB Console JTAG interface</strong>.</p>\n",

The 1GbE port serves as the primary management interface, configured to obtain its IP address via the <strong>DHCP protocol</strong>. This port requires an internet connection for hardware initialization and firmware updates. While using a router with internet connectivity is a common approach, it adds unnecessary hardware and cables. More importantly, users with network access restrictions may find that a router doesn't provide full internet access. Therefore, we recommend establishing a direct connection between the 1GbE port and a host computer that shares its full-access internet connection. Below, we provide connection solutions for Mac, Ubuntu, and Windows platforms:</p>\n<h3>Key Steps for Mac:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Connect the X4x0's 1GbE interface directly to your Mac using an Ethernet cable.</li>\n<li>Open System Preferences and search for 'Sharing'.</li>\n<li>Select \"Internet Sharing\" from the search results.</li>\n<li>Choose your Wi-Fi network from the \"<em>Share your connection from</em>\" menu.</li>\n<li>Select the Ethernet port connected to the X4x0 in the \"<em>To computers using</em>\" list.</li>\n<li>Within a minute, the USRP should acquire an IP address and internet access.</li>\n<li>For users with limited internet access, install proxy software with LAN Sharing capabilities on your Mac.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Key Steps for Ubuntu:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Connect the X4x0's 1GbE interface directly to your Ubuntu machine using an Ethernet cable.</li>\n<li>Open System Preferences and navigate to Network settings.</li>\n<li>Select the Ethernet connection that connects to the X4x0.</li>\n<li>Go to the IPv4 Settings tab and select \"Shared to other computers\".</li>\n<li>Click Save to apply the changes.</li>\n<li>Within a minute, the USRP should acquire an IP address and internet access.</li>\n<li>For users with limited internet access, install proxy software with LAN Sharing capabilities on your Ubuntu machine.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>Key Steps for Windows:</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Connect the X4x0's 1GbE interface directly to your PC using an Ethernet cable.</li>\n<li>Open Control Panel and navigate to Network and Sharing Center &gt; Change adapter settings.</li>\n<li>Right-click your internet connection (e.g., WiFi) and select \"Properties\".</li>\n<li>Go to the Sharing tab and check \"Allow other network users to connect through this computer's Internet connection\".</li>\n<li>Select the Ethernet connection used by the X4x0 from the dropdown menu under \"Home networking connection\".</li>\n<li>Click OK to enable Internet Sharing.</li>\n<li>Within a minute, the USRP should acquire an IP address and internet access.</li>\n<li>For users with limited internet access, install proxy software with LAN Sharing capabilities on your PC.</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Device Discovery</h2>\n<p>After setting up the network sharing as described above, the X4x0 device should have obtained an IP address. You can verify this by running the <code>uhd_find_devices</code> command on your host computer. This command should display the detected X4x0 device with its IP address.</p>\n<div class=\"hint-container info\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Info</p>\n<p>The <code>uhd_find_devices</code> command is provided by the USRP Hardware Driver (UHD).

      "content_html": "<div class=\"hint-container tip\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Tips</p>\n<p>如果您不想费劲地看英文，请开启浏览器的翻译功能，省脑子。</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Hardware Installation</h2>\n<p>PicoScenes currently supports 4 commercial Wi-Fi NIC models and SDR devices, including the AX200 (or AX201), AX210(or AX211), QCA9300 and IWL5300, all models of USRP devices, and the HackRF One.</p>\n<p>The most welcomed feature of PicoScenes is the concurrent operation of multiple RF frontends, i.e., simultaneous CSI measurement or packet injection using a commercial Wi-Fi NIC/SDR array. To help you get the hardware ready, we share some hardware preparation experience, mainly focusing on the multi-devices setup.</p>\n<h3>Installation of (Multiple) Commercial Wi-Fi NICs</h3>\n<p>We recommend three methods for installing multiple NICs.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PCI-E 1x Adapter-based Multi-NIC Installation</strong></p>\n<p>With the help of the <code>Mini PCI-E to PCI-E 1x adapter</code> or <code>M.2 to PCI-E 1x adapter</code>, you can install multiple NICs directly on the motherboard of a desktop PC.</p>\n<p>However, there are usually only 2 or 3 spare PCI-E slots left for the Wi-Fi NICs. To overcome this issue, you may choose <strong>cryptocurrency mining motherboards</strong>, such as the MSI B360-F Pro. These types of motherboards have dozens of PCI-E 1x slots, and you can use <strong>PCI-E slot risers</strong> to install <em>dozens</em> of Wi-Fi NICs on a single motherboard.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Multi-Mini PCI-E/M.2 Slots-Based Multi-NIC Installation</strong></p>\n<p>This is the most convenient approach for installing multiple NICs. The onboard Mini PCI-E or M.2 slots eliminate the need for PCI-E 1x adapters.<br>\nWith some hardware and software tricks, we modified an old laptop model, the ThinkPad X201, and installed two Mini PCI-E/M.2-based Wi-Fi NICs. Moreover, <strong>the X201 enables you to install three SMA-based external antennas!</strong> The following photo shows our modified ThinkPad X201 equipped with both the QCA9300 and IWL5300 NICs and three external antennas. The laptop can also install an AX210/AX200 using an M.2-to-Mini PCI-E converter.</p>\n<p></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>PCI-E Bridge Adapter-Based Multi-NIC Installation</strong></p>\n<p>The PCI-E bridge adapter can split one PCI-E connection into multiple connections, similar to a PCI-E hub. Therefore, you can connect multiple NICs to only one of the motherboard's PCI-E slots via the bridge adapter.</p>\n<p>Moreover, you can build a multi-layer hierarchy of bridge adapters and install NICs to all the leaf nodes. In this way, you can theoretically install over 100 Wi-Fi NICs in your system. To validate the feasibility of this approach, we built a 27-NIC Wi-Fi ISAC array using a 3-layer hierarchy of 1-to-3 PCI-E bridge adapters. The figure below shows the picture and layout of the 27-NIC array. The entire array is encapsulated in an IKEA box.</p>\n<p></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"hint-container tip\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Tips</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>Do you want to access research-ready hardware out of the box?

Therefore, please follow the steps below to configure and verify the USRP hardware.</p>\n<h4>Installing PicoScenes Software</h4>\n<p>Before setting up the USRP hardware, you should install the PicoScenes software first. Please follow the instructions in the <a href=\"#picoscenes-software-installation\">PicoScenes Software Installation</a> section to install PicoScenes. Please note that PicoScenes depends on specific version of UHD. If you have previously installed your own compiled version of UHD, please uninstall it before proceeding.</p>\n<div class=\"hint-container tip\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Tips</p>\n<p>The driver installation or build process listed on the USRP Official site can be complicated and prone to errors. To simplify this process, we have built and packaged the PicoScenes software using the USRP driver shipped with the Ubuntu system. Therefore, by installing PicoScenes software, you will also be installing the USRP driver.</p>\n</div>\n<h4>Configuring USRP Hardware</h4>\n<p>You should set up your hardware according to the USRP official <a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_devices.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Devices &amp; Usage Manual</a>. Read and follow the Get Started sections according to your USRP models.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://kb.ettus.com/B200/B210/B200mini/B205mini\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual: B200/B210/B200mini/B205mini</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_usrp2.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual: USRP2 and N2x0 Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_usrp_x3x0.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual: USRP X3x0 Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_usrp_n3xx.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual: USRP N3x0 Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_usrp_x4xx.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USRP Hardware Driver and USRP Manual: USRP X4x0 Series</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_multiple.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Multiple USRP configuration</a></li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"hint-container tip\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Tips</p>\n<p>The PicoScenes software installer installs the UHD software. So, you skip the UHD installation or source code building steps.</p>\n</div>\n<h5>Suggestions for NI USRP Hardware Setup</h5>\n<p>Based on our experience, we have the following suggestions for setting up USRP hardware:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>X3x0 Series: It is <strong>not recommended to use a PCI-E cable-based connection</strong> due to inefficiency in both hardware and cost. This method has two major drawbacks. Firstly, the PCI-E-based connection is hardware-inefficient as it requires one cable or extension card for each X3x0 device. This can be very expensive and may not be feasible for a desktop PC with limited spare PCI-E slots. Secondly, the UHD software does not support a hybrid combination of the PCI-E-based link and the GbE/10GbE-based link, further limiting its application.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>X3x0 and N3x0 Series: We highly <strong>recommend using 10GbE connection and the Intel X710 Quad Port 10 Gb Ethernet Adapter</strong>. This is a reasonable and cost-effective solution for connecting multiple X3x0 and N3x0 devices. It occupies only one full-size PCI-E slot but provides four 10GbE ports, allowing you to connect up to four X3x0 or N3x0 devices.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>N2x0 Series: Consider using MIMO cables to achieve MIMO and phased array capabilities. However, note that MIMO cables have a narrow bandwidth.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Multiple USRP Devices: As clearly stated in <a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_multiple.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Multiple USRP configuration</a>, UHD only supports combining multiple USRP devices of the same model. Currently, the N2x0 and X3x0 series are the only combination-ready models.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Daughterboard Selection: For both the N2x0 and X3x0 series, it is advisable to consider using the UBX-40/UBX-160 daughterboard. Although these daughterboards are expensive, they are the only ones that support daughterboard-level phase synchronization, which is necessary for PicoScenes to achieve phased-array functionality.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>IP Address Allocation: Pay special attention to the allocation of IP addresses. For network-based connections, the Ethernet NIC port and the connected USRP must be in the same subnet. If they are not in the same subnet, the UHD device discovery program 'uhd_find_devices' may still find the devices, but PicoScenes will not be able to initialize them correctly.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Clock Synchronization: For clock synchronization, the OctoClock-G from EttusResearch is a cost-effective choice. It can distribute GPS-disciplined clocks to up to eight USRP devices.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h4>Verifying Hardware Installation</h4>\n<p>To ensure that your USRP is ready for PicoScenes, follow the four-stage verification process outlined below.</p>\n<h5>Verifying Hardware Connection</h5>\n<p>Open a terminal and execute the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"language-bash line-numbers-mode\" data-highlighter=\"shiki\" data-ext=\"bash\" data-title=\"bash\" style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34\"><pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF\">uhd_find_devices</span></span></code></pre>\n<div class=\"line-numbers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"counter-reset:line-number 0\"><div class=\"line-number\"></div></div></div><p>The uhd_find_devices command is provided by UHD as a device discovery program. It will list all the connected USRP devices. If your device is not displayed, please refer to the USRP manual for troubleshooting steps to check the hardware connection.</p>\n<h5>Verifying Firmware Version</h5>\n<p>Open a terminal and execute the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"language-bash line-numbers-mode\" data-highlighter=\"shiki\" data-ext=\"bash\" data-title=\"bash\" style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34\"><pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF\">uhd_usrp_probe</span></span></code></pre>\n<div class=\"line-numbers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"counter-reset:line-number 0\"><div class=\"line-number\"></div></div></div><p>The uhd_usrp_probe command prints the hardware details of all connected devices and checks whether the devices’ firmware versions are consistent with the UHD software installed on the host computer. If any inconsistencies are detected, you can use the uhd_image_loader command to flash the latest firmware to the USRP.</p>\n<p>To update the firmware for USRP N2x0 devices, run the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"language-bash line-numbers-mode\" data-highlighter=\"shiki\" data-ext=\"bash\" data-title=\"bash\" style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34\"><pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF\">uhd_image_loader</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#986801;--shiki-dark:#D19A66\"> --args=</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#50A14F;--shiki-dark:#98C379\">\"type=usrp2\"</span></span></code></pre>\n<div class=\"line-numbers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"counter-reset:line-number 0\"><div class=\"line-number\"></div></div></div><p>For USRP X3x0 devices, use the following command to update the firmware:</p>\n<div class=\"language-bash line-numbers-mode\" data-highlighter=\"shiki\" data-ext=\"bash\" data-title=\"bash\" style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34\"><pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF\">uhd_image_loader</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#986801;--shiki-dark:#D19A66\"> --args=</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#50A14F;--shiki-dark:#98C379\">\"type=x300\"</span></span></code></pre>\n<div class=\"line-numbers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"counter-reset:line-number 0\"><div class=\"line-number\"></div></div></div><h5>Verifying Signal Reception (RX)</h5>\n<p>To check if your USRP can receive the signal, you can use UHD's <code>uhd_fft</code> command. Execute the following command:</p>\n<div class=\"language-bash line-numbers-mode\" data-highlighter=\"shiki\" data-ext=\"bash\" data-title=\"bash\" style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34\"><pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#4078F2;--shiki-dark:#61AFEF\">uhd_fft</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#986801;--shiki-dark:#D19A66\"> --args=</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#50A14F;--shiki-dark:#98C379\">\"ADDRESS_STRING\"</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#986801;--shiki-dark:#D19A66\"> -f</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#50A14F;--shiki-dark:#98C379\"> 2412e6</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#986801;--shiki-dark:#D19A66\"> -s</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#50A14F;--shiki-dark:#98C379\"> 20e6</span></span></code></pre>\n<div class=\"line-numbers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"counter-reset:line-number 0\"><div class=\"line-number\"></div></div></div><p>Replace <code>ADDRESS_STRING</code> with the USRP identification string. For more details, refer to the <a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_identification.html#id_identifying_common\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USRP Common Device Identifiers</a>.</p>\n<h5>Tx/Rx Self-Calibration (for USRP N2x0, X3x0, and N3x0 users)</h5>\n<p>Uncalibrated daughterboards can introduce <code>serious</code> signal distortion. It is recommended to perform calibrations for EACH daughterboard following the instructions in the <a href=\"https://files.ettus.com/manual/page_calibration.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Device Calibration</a> section. Calibrating the frequency range that covers your intended measurements will help achieve the best signal quality.</p>\n<h3>Installation of (Multiple) HackRF One</h3>\n<p>The installation and verification process for HackRF One is relatively simpler compared to USRP. Please follow the steps below to complete the installation and verification.</p>\n<h4>Installing The PicoScenes Software</h4>\n<p>Before setting up the HackRF One hardware, you should install the PicoScenes software first. you should follow <a href=\"#picoscenes-software-installation\">PicoScenes Software Installation</a> section to install the PicoScenes software.</p>\n<h4>Verifying Hardware Connection</h4>\n<p>The HackRF One is a USB 2.0 interfaced SDR device, so you can simply plug in the device.

USRP产品。当然，作为NI授权经销商，<em>我们也销售其它其他型号</em>。</p>\n<h3>NI USRP B210</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/ub210-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USRP B210</a> 是NI USRP系列的入门神器，它功能丰富，非常适合新用户。它提供两对Tx/Rx通道，支持70-6000 MHz频谱以及最大61.44/30.72MHz采样（单/双通道）。它采用AD9361前端，支持2x2 MIMO，支持Radar mode，提供细粒度的采样频率指定、自动I/Q校正(<em>无需手动校正!</em>)、自带AGC，支持外接时钟同步，采用USB 3.0连接和供电，可支持笔记本电脑作为上位机在外场直接工作。它能够满足在最大40 MHz CBW下进行各种精细的Wi-Fi/5G/6G ISAC研究的需求。</p>\n<p>USRP B210原厂仅以祼板销售，<a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/usrp-b200-enclosure/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">B210 NI原厂外壳</a> 单独售卖，并且很贵(1500元)，但还是推荐用户购买，原因如下：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>长期的USRP使用经验告诉我们，<strong>USRP非常脆弱，如果不使用外壳，极容易损坏</strong>。</li>\n<li>NI原厂外壳在拍摄论文照片时更加直观和美观。</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>NI USRP X310母板搭配双UBX-160子板</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/X310-KIT/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NI USRP X310母板</a> 搭配两块 <a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/ubx160/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">UBX-160子板</a>，可以实现10-6000 MHz范围内最大双通道200 MHz采样能力，支持Radar mode，时钟同步方面，它支持输出时钟信号也支持输入外部时钟信号，支持USRP多设备组合功能，可实现多机、多通道条件下的时钟同步。它提供双口10 GbE连接能力，可通过10 GbE以太网网卡连接台式电脑或通过10GbE-to-Thunderbolt3转换器连接带有Thunderbolt3接口的笔记本电脑，可满足Wi-Fi 160 MHz CBW下多种收发和测量任务。</p>\n<h3>NI USRP-2974</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ni.com/zh-cn/shop/model/usrp-2974.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NI USRP-2974</a> 这个型号是NI品牌预组装的产品，它的实质是：NI USRP X310母板 + 两块UBX-160子板 + GPSDO（GPS驯服时钟）+ 一台4核心2GHz主频i7(6822EQ)小主机。相比上述X310+Dual UBX-160方案，在保留双10 GbE连接的基础上，由于机器内置了一台中等性能的小主机，该型号具备开箱即用的能力。</p>\n<h3>NI USRP X310母板搭配双TwinRx子板</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/X310-KIT/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NI USRP X310母板</a> 搭配两块 <a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/twinrx/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">TwinRx子板</a>，可以实现10-6000 MHz范围内最大4通道100 MHz Rx采样能力。请注意，TwinRx子板仅具备Rx，不提供Tx（所以称为TwinRx）。时钟同步方面，它支持输出时钟信号也支持输入外部时钟信号，支持USRP多设备组合功能，可实现多机、多通道条件下的时钟同步。它提供双口10 GbE连接能力，可通过10 GbE以太网网卡连接台式电脑或通过10GbE-to-Thunderbolt3转换器连接带有Thunderbolt3接口的笔记本电脑，可满足Wi-Fi 80 MHz CBW下多种收发和测量任务。</p>\n<p>NI有一个更有性价比的开箱即4x4 MIMO Tx/Rx的硬件，是 <a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/usrp-n310/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NI USRP N310</a>，它相比NI USRP X310母板搭配双TwinRx子板的方案更便宜，还支持4通道Tx，但是 <strong>我们不推荐Wi-Fi ISAC用户采购NI USRP N310</strong>。原因在于，NI USRP N310的master clock仅有122.88, 125, 153.6 MSPS/s这三种，这几个频率与Wi-Fi的 20/40/80/160 MHz带宽均不匹配。为了在Wi-Fi的带宽工作，NI USRP N310始终需要基带重采样，性能损失严重，故不推荐。</p>\n<h3>NI USRP N320/N321</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/usrp-n320/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NI USRP N320</a> 的总体性能略高于X310或USRP-2974平台，它可实现3-6000 MHz范围，最大双通道250 MHz采样，支持Radar mode，时钟同步方面，它支持输出时钟信号也支持输入外部时钟信号，支持USRP多设备组合功能，可实现多机、多通道条件下的时钟同步。它提供双口10GbE连接能力，可通过10 GbE以太网网卡连接台式电脑或通过10 GbE-to-Thunderbolt

USRP N321</a> 搭配使用，实现载波相位级同步。PicoScenes提供了Tx Precoding API，支持基于N321/N320组合的Wi-Fi beamforming/phased array相关研究。</p>\n<h3>NI USRP X410</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/usrp-x410/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NI USRP X410</a> 是USRP系统目前性能最强的设备，它可在1-7200 MHz范围，最大4通道400 MHz采样(<a href=\"/my-docs/userManual/scenarios.html#listening-to-4080160320-mhz-bandwidth-channels\" target=\"_blank\">Listening to 40/80/160/320 MHz Bandwidth Channels</a>, <a

Frames</a>)。为支持最大1.6 GSPS的基带信号传输，X410配备了100 GbE连接。时钟同步方面，它内置GPSDO，也支持输出时钟信号也支持输入外部时钟信号(<a href=\"/my-docs/userManual/scenarios.html#clock-synchronization-across-multiple-usrp-devices\" target=\"_blank\">Clock Synchronization across Multiple USRP Devices</a>)，支持USRP多设备组合功能(<a href=\"/my-docs/userManual/scenarios.html#combining-multiple-usrp-devices\" target=\"_blank\">Combining Multiple USRP devices</a>)，支持Radar mode(<a href=\"/my-docs/userManual/scenarios.html#wi-fi-radar-802-11bf-mono-static-sensing-mode-with-802-11a-g-n-ac-ax-be-frame-format\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi Radar (802.11bf Mono-Static Sensing Mode) with 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax/be Frame Format</a>)，可实现多机、多通道条件下的时钟同步。</p>\n<h3>NI OctoClock-G</h3>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/OctoClock-G/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NI OctoClock-G</a> 是一台非常好用的时钟分配单元。它内置一块GPSDO（GPS驯服时钟），在GPS接入时，可提供 &lt;1 ppb水平的频率精度；并支持将此时钟分配给最多8个设备。它也提供了开关，可以在内置的GPSDO和外置时钟源切换。</p>\n<h2>其它要考虑的因素</h2>\n<h3>我需要买几台设备？</h3>\n<p>您在确定设备采购台数时，可考虑以下因素：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Radar Mode(<a href=\"/my-docs/userManual/scenarios.html#wi-fi-radar-802-11bf-mono-static-sensing-mode-with-802-11a-g-n-ac-ax-be-frame-format\" target=\"_blank\">Wi-Fi Radar (802.11bf Mono-Static Sensing Mode) with 802.11a/g/n/ac/ax/be Frame Format</a>)是对USRP新用户非常友好的模式，仅需要一台NI USRP B210就可以进行感知研究；</li>\n<li>为了构成基于USRP的Tx-Rx链路，请考虑采购2台；当然，如果您预备有限，也可以使用一台USRP和商用Wi-Fi网卡进行Wi-Fi ISAC研究；</li>\n<li>初次采购时，请考虑是否需要OctoClock-G时钟，用于时钟同步、相位对齐等操作（Radar Mode收发链路自同步，无需采购时钟！）；</li>\n<li>NI USRP系列每年两次调（涨）价，并且幅度不低，每次在5-10%左右。所以如果经费允许，可考虑增加采购量；</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>您需要对货期有预估</h3>\n<p>NI USRP系列完全由NI在马来西亚或匈牙利的工厂按订单生产，从生产、寄出、清关最终交付您手上，大约需要4-6周时间（一般来说4周概率高）。如果您有一些关键的项目时间节点，请提前规划。</p>\n<h3>强烈推荐您采购NI原厂延保服务</h3>\n<p>根据我们的使用经验以及来自NI的反馈，USRP系列设备确实非常容易损坏，尤其是对于新手用户。NI原厂为正品设备自出库之日起提供1年原厂质保，该质保为不区分人为因素、不限次数的免费维修服务。<strong>但是，一旦过保，单次维护费用则是设备售价的30%</strong>！例如一台X310套装12万元左右，不论如何轻微的损坏，单次维修费用都高达3.6万元左右，属实极为昂贵。这对广大科研用户会有两个突出的问题：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>维修价格昂贵，经费不易申请；</li>\n<li>有经费也想维修，但因申报书中没有预算维修费，因无法报销而无法维修；</li>\n</ol>\n<p>NI原厂提供 <strong>随硬件一次性购买</strong> 的USRP延保服务：该延保服务随设备一并采购，<strong>每延长一年质保仅额外支付售价的5%，最多延长4年。</strong> 例如，X310套装售价12万元左右，如果您想延长4年质保（总共5年），则额外支付2.4万元，总计14.4万元。延保期间，保修政策不变，这意味着两点优势：</p>\n<ol>\n<li>以20%的费用，获得5年内不限次数、不区别人为因素的维修服务；这相比单次维修30%的维修费，<strong>堪称良心</strong></li>\n<li>质保+延保期间，无需担心高昂的维修费以及报销等问题。</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>报价与支付方式</h2>\n<h3>USRP产品的厂商指导价 v.s 我们的报价规则</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>厂商指导价：USRP产品相对小众，NI推荐各授权经销商以\"询价\"方式接触用户。该模式对大部分用户并不友好，因为用户并不知道NI的产品指导价，所以用户处于信息明显不对称的劣势位置，或者说——韭菜。但实际上，<strong>USRP的厂商指导价一直是公开透明的</strong>，公式很简单： NI或Ettus官网的美元或人民币价格 * 1.13（税）+ [NI对Ettus产品根据型号额外加的费用大约1000~10000元] = 厂商指导价。例如 USRP B210型号，<a href=\"https://www.ettus.com/all-products/ub210-kit/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">Ettus官网售价2101美元</a>（23年11月），按以上公式算得17979元，接近厂商指导价格（23年11月）；再例如NI USRP-2974型号，<a href=\"https://www.ni.com/zh-cn/shop/model/usrp-2974.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">NI官网售价169495元人民币</a>（23年11月），按以上公式算得191529元人民币，即接近厂商指导价格（23年11月）。</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>我们的报价：我们遵守NI的规则，不公开准确的厂商指导价格。但为了兑现\"不追求过分利润\"的承诺，同时消除询价过程的沟通成本，我们统一 <em>对厂商指导价格百位四舍五入</em>，作为我们这里的一口价报价。</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>我们的报价（2024年5月）</h3>\n<p>| 型号 | 报价（元）| 延保1年 | 延保2年 | 延保3年 | 延保4年 |<br>\n|</p>\n",

The second command sentence starts with <code>//</code> or <code>#</code>, it is recognized as a line of comment and is skipped. The remaining command sentences are:</p>\n<ol>\n<li><code>-d debug</code></li>\n<li><code>-i 4 --freq 2412e6 --rate 20e6 --mode responder --rxcm 3 --cbw 40 --sts 2 --txcm 5 -ess 1 --txpower 15 --coding ldpc</code>;</li>\n<li><code>-i 3 --freq 2412e6 --rate 20e6 --mode initiator --repeat 100 --delay 5000 --cf 2412e6:5e6:2484e6 --sf 20e6:5e6:40e6 --cbw 20 --sts 2 --mcs 0 --gi 400 --txcm 3 --ack-mcs 3  --ack-type header</code>;</li>\n<li><code>-q</code></li>\n</ol>\n<p>Each command sentence composes of one or multiple <code>program options</code>. Each program option usually starts with <code>--</code>. For some frequently used options, we provide shortcuts, like <code>-i</code> is for <code>--interface</code>, <code>-q</code> is for <code>--quit</code> and <code>-d</code> is for <code>--log-display-level</code>. Each program option consists of the option name and zero or more parameters, for example <code>--no-hp</code> doesn't require a parameter, and user may provide multiple parameters for <code>--tx-channel</code>, like <code>--tx-channel 0,1,2,3</code>.</p>\n<p><strong>PicoScenes parses and executes the command sentence in input order</strong>. For the program options within one command sentence, PicoScenes invokes <strong>four levels of program option parsers to parse them</strong>; therefore, the order of the program options does not matter. The four levels of parsers, in their hierarchical order, are Platform Startup Options, Platform Options, Frontend Level Options, and Per-Plugin Level Options. They are detailed in the following Program Options Hierarchy. Platform Startup Options and Platform Options are frontend-irrelevant, and the other two levels of parsers are frontend-related.</p>\n<p>The following process simulates the real parsing process of the above command sentences.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p>For the first command sentence <code>-d debug</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Platform Startup Option parser recognizes the <code>-d debug</code> option, and set the debug message display level to <code>debug</code>.</li>\n<li>Platform Option parser recognizes nothing.</li>\n<li>As no frontend is specified, Frontend Option parser and Per-Plugin Option parsers are skipped.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the second command sentence <code>-i 4 --freq 2412e6 --rate 20e6 --mode responder --rxcm 3 --cbw 40 --sts 2 --txcm 5 -ess 1 --txpower 15 --coding ldpc</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Platform Startup Option parser recognizes nothing.</li>\n<li>Platform Option parser recognizes <code>-i 3</code>, indicating that the rest of the program options within this command sentence are all for NIC <code>3</code>.</li>\n<li>Frontend Option parser recognizes 5 hardware-tuning options: <code>--freq 2412e6</code>, <code>--rate 20e6</code>, <code>--rxcm 3</code> <code>--txcm 5</code>, and <code>--txpower 16</code>. All these controls are for NIC <code>3</code>, and Frontend Option parser doesn't perform the hardware tuning but delegates these parameters to the FrontEnd class.</li>\n<li>Each PicoScenes plugin has the ability to parse command sentence, and PicoScenes enumerates all the active plugin instances of NIC <code>3</code> and let them parse the current command sentence. In the above example, the program option parser of EchoProbe plugin recognizes 5 options, namely, <code>--mode responder</code>, <code>--cbw 40</code>, <code>--sts 2</code>, <code>--ess 1</code> and <code>--coding ldpc</code>. The <code>responder mode</code> of EchoProbe plugin is not a thread-blocking mode, therefore, the parser of EchoProbe plugin will save the parameters and exit.</li>\n<li>PicoScenes continues to enumerate the rest of the plugins (if there are) and let them parse the same command sentence.</li>\n<li>All four level of parsers finish their jobs, PicoScenes continues to next command sentence.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the third command sentence <code>-i 3 --freq 2412e6 --rate 20e6 --mode initiator --repeat 100 --delay 5000 --cf 2412e6:5e6:2484e6 --sf 20e6:5e6:40e6 --cbw 20 --sts 2 --mcs 0 --gi 400 --txcm 3 --ack-mcs 3  --ack-type header</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Platform Startup Option parser recognizes nothing.</li>\n<li>Platform Option parser recognizes <code>-i 4</code>, indicating this the rest of the program options are all for NIC <code>4</code>.</li>\n<li>Frontend Option parser recognizes 3 program options <code>--freq 2412e6</code>, <code>--rate 20e6</code>, <code>--txcm 3</code>. All these controls are for NIC <code>4</code>, and Frontend Option parser doesn't perform the hardware tuning but delegates these parameters to the FrontEnd class.</li>\n<li>PicoScenes enumerates all the active plugin instances of NIC <code>4</code> and let them parse the current command sentence. The program option parser of EchoProbe plugin recognizes 11 options, namely, <code>–mode initiator</code>, <code>–-repeat 100</code>, <code>-–delay 5000</code>, <code>-–cf 2412e6:5e6:2484e6</code>, <code>-–sf 20e6:5e6:40e6</code> <code>-–cbw 20</code>, <code>-–sts 2</code>, <code>-–mcs 0</code>, <code>-–gi 400</code>,  <code>-–ack-mcs 3</code> and <code>-–ack-type header</code>. The <code>initiator mode</code> of EchoProbe plugin is a blocking mode.  NIC <code>4</code>'s EchoProbe plugin instance will perform the round-trip and spectrum-scanning CSI measurement. When the measurement finishes or fails, EchoProbe will exit the blocking state.</li>\n<li>PicoScenes continue to enumerate the rest of the plugins (if there are) and let them parse the same command sentence.</li>\n<li>All four level of parsers finish their jobs, PicoScenes continues to next command sentence.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>For the fourth command sentence <code>-q</code>:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Platform Startup Option parser recognizes nothing.</li>\n<li>Platform Option parser recognizes <code>-q</code> and trigger PicoScenes shutdown sequence.</li>\n</ol>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<h2>Program Options Hierarchy</h2>\n<p>Various PicoScenes program options are organized in a hierarchical structure as listed below:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Per-Plugin level Options (Top)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Each PicoScenes plugin can have its own program options. For example, the EchoProbe plugin has a large set of options controlling the packet injection and round-trip measurement.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Frontend Level Options</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>PicoScenes provides two independent sets of options for QCA9300/IWL5300 and SDR frontends, respectively. Users specify different options for different Wi-Fi NICs or USRPs.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Platform Options</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>These are a few global options valid <em>after</em> the launch of the PicoScenes platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Platform Startup Options (Bottom)</strong></p>\n<ul>\n<li>These are a few global options valid <em>before</em> the launch of the PicoScenes platform.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<div class=\"hint-container tip\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Tips</p>\n<p>You can also look up the <strong>complete</strong> program options by running the command <code>PicoScenes --help</code>, if you have successfully installed the PicoScenes.</p>\n</div>\n<h2>Platform Startup Options (Bottom)</h2>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><code>--plugin-dir &lt;new_plugin_dir&gt;</code></p>\n<ul>\n<li>Description: Change the plugin search directory to your specified directory, e.g. <code>--plugin-dir /home/YOUR_HOME/PicoScenes-PDK</code>.

During this process, you will learn how to git clone PS-PDK code, compile it, modify it, debug it, and imitate it. You will also have a general understanding of <code>modern C++</code> development on the Linux platform.</p>\n<h2>Prerequisites</h2>\n<p>PicoScenes Plugin Development Kit (PS-PDK), as a standard C++ library, includes the PicoScenes <code>C/C++ headers</code> and <code>libraries</code>. If you have installed PicoScenes software, PS-PDK is already in your system. The headers and the binary library files are installed at <code>/usr/local/PicoScenes/include/PicoScenes</code> and <code>/usr/local/PicoScenes/lib</code>, respectively. You may refer to the document <a href=\"/my-docs/userManual/installation.html\" target=\"_blank\">installation</a> to ensure your installation.</p>\n<h3>Install necessary development dependencies</h3>\n<p>Run the following command to install the dependencies for PS-PDK development.</p>\n<div class=\"language-bash line-numbers-mode\" data-highlighter=\"shiki\" data-ext=\"bash\"

recommand JetBrains <strong>CLion</strong> as the IDE for PicoScenes plugin development.</p>\n<h2>Developing PicoScenes Plugins</h2>\n<h3>PicoScenes Plugin Overview</h3>\n<p>The following image illustrates the relationship between PicoScenes-plugin and PicoScenes.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The top box is labeled \"PicoScenes Application Plugins,\" which contains multiple sub-boxes marked as \"Plugin-1,\" \"Plugin-2,\" through \"Plugin-n,\" indicating that there are multiple plugins available for use by the PicoScenes platform. These plugins are managed through an intermediary box, \"Plugins Manager,\" signifying that all plugins are uniformly managed by this plugin manager.</p>\n<p>The process begins with the initiation of the platform, followed by the automatic detection of all available plugins. After detection, each plugin is systematically installed. Once the installation is complete, the system <a href=\"#picoscenes-plugin-folder-structure\">parses user commands</a> and proceeds to poll each plugin to verify if they meet the requirements of the commands. Upon confirmation, the system executes the corresponding plugins.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>The plugin has the capability to control all hardware on the platform, with all functions and APIs within its realm of control. It is capable of <a href=\"#how-to-receive-packages\">receiving</a> and <a href=\"#how-to-transmit-packages\">transmitting</a> data flows, including WiFi packets. Once the hardware platform captures a packet, it forwards this data to all plugins, ensuring that each one receives the packet.</p>\n<p>\"Imitation is not just the sincerest form of flattery - it's the sincerest form of learning.\" -- George Bernard Shaw</p>\n<div class=\"hint-container tip\">\n<p class=\"hint-container-title\">Tips</p>\n<p>You can learn how to write plugins step by step following the tutorial, or you can view the complete code in the <a href=\"https://github.com/wifisensing/PicoScenes-PDK/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">repository</a>.</p>\n</div>\n<h3>PicoScenes Plugin folder structure</h3>\n<p>The entire PS-PDK project is managed by <code>CMake</code> and contains three working plugins, a Demo plugin, the EchoProbe, and UDP-forwarder.</p>\n<p><code>PicoScenes-PDK/CMakeLists.txt</code></p>\n<div class=\"language-cmake line-numbers-mode\" data-highlighter=\"shiki\" data-ext=\"cmake\" data-title=\"cmake\" style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34\"><pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A0A1A7;--shiki-light-font-style:italic;--shiki-dark:#7F848E;--shiki-dark-font-style:italic\"># ...</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD\">add_subdirectory</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF\">(plugin-demo)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD\">add_subdirectory</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF\">(plugin-echoprobe)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD\">add_subdirectory</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF\">(plugin-forwarder)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A0A1A7;--shiki-light-font-style:italic;--shiki-dark:#7F848E;--shiki-dark-font-style:italic\"># ...</span></span></code></pre>\n<div class=\"line-numbers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"counter-reset:line-number 0\"><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div></div></div><ul>\n<li><code>add_subdirectory(plugin-demo)</code>: searches CMakeLists.txt in <code>plugin-demo</code></li>\n</ul>\n<p><code>PicoScenes-PDK/plugin-demo/CMakeLists.txt</code></p>\n<div class=\"language-cmake line-numbers-mode\" data-highlighter=\"shiki\" data-ext=\"cmake\" data-title=\"cmake\" style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#abb2bf;--shiki-light-bg:#FAFAFA;--shiki-dark-bg:#282c34\"><pre class=\"shiki shiki-themes one-light one-dark-pro vp-code\"><code><span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A0A1A7;--shiki-light-font-style:italic;--shiki-dark:#7F848E;--shiki-dark-font-style:italic\"># PicoScenes-PDK/plugin-demo/CMakeLists.txt</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A0A1A7;--shiki-light-font-style:italic;--shiki-dark:#7F848E;--shiki-dark-font-style:italic\"># The PicoScenes Plugins MUST be named in \"PDK-xxx\" pattern.</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD\">ADD_LIBRARY</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF\">(PDK-demo SHARED DemoPlugin.cxx)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD\">TARGET_LINK_LIBRARIES</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF\">(PDK-demo  </span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD\">${Boost_LIBRARIES}</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF\"> fmt::fmt SystemTools)</span></span>\n<span class=\"line\"><span style=\"--shiki-light:#A626A4;--shiki-dark:#C678DD\">install</span><span style=\"--shiki-light:#383A42;--shiki-dark:#ABB2BF\">(TARGETS PDK-demo  DESTINATION .)</span></span></code></pre>\n<div class=\"line-numbers\" aria-hidden=\"true\" style=\"counter-reset:line-number 0\"><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div><div class=\"line-number\"></div></div></div><p>DemoPlugin Inherits from AbstractPicoScenesPlugin.

problem of plugin development emerges, <code>how to debug a plugin?</code></p>\n<p>Xincheng Ren, one of our contributors, records a .gif video describing the plugin debug process. In this video, we use JetBrains CLion as our IDE. To debug the EchoProbe plugin, rather than specifying the .so plugin file as the <code>debug main program</code>, you must specify the PicoScenes main program at <code>/usr/local/PicoScenes/bin/</code> to be the <code>debug main program</code>. Second, you should also add <code>--plugin-dir /path-to-plugin</code> program option to tell PicoScenes main program to load your plugins.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can download this .gif video from <a

In this video, we use JetBrains CLion as our IDE. To debug the EchoProbe plugin, rather than specifying the .so plugin file as the <code>debug main program</code>, you must specify the PicoScenes main program at <code>/usr/local/PicoScenes/bin/</code> to be the <code>debug main program</code>. Second, you should also add <code>--plugin-dir /path-to-plugin</code> program option to tell PicoScenes main program to load your plugins.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>You can download this .gif video from <a href=\"../images/Plugin-Debug.gif\">Debug Plugin</a>.</p>\n",

This work proposes to reshape the current research paradigm of Wi-Fi ISAC (Wi-Fi Integrated Sensing and Communication) with the proposed high-coherence hardware capabilities, and has been validated through two high-precision sensing demos. As research in this direction is still exploratory, this list of capabilities may change over time, so we hope to continuously update our research in this direction through this online page to promote the practical application of these capabilities.</p>\n<h2>Download</h2>\n<p>The main article and supplementaries can be downloaded at <a href=\"../_static/Reshaping-Main.pdf\">Reshaping Wi-Fi ISAC with High-Coherence Hardware Capabilities</a> and <a href=\"../_static/Reshaping-Supplementary.pdf\">Supplementaries</a>.</p>\n<h2>What Can High-Coherence Hardware Capabilities Bring?</h2>\n<p>With high-coherence hardware capabilities, the CSI data will recover high-coherence characteristics in five dimensions: time, frequency, phase, amplitude, and space, enabling the support for various coherent algorithms from the radar field to be ported to the Wi-Fi platform, significantly enhancing the capacity and capabilities of Wi-Fi sensing.</p>\n<h2>About the Two Demos</h2>\n<p>Both demos are developed based on the PicoScenes platform, and we will open source the core implementation of the two demos at an appropriate time in the future.</p>\n<h2>About Us</h2>\n<p>We are a Wi-Fi \"industry-academia-research\" alliance that includes academia, industry, standards, certification, and major customers. Our goal is to build an open \"industry-academia-research\" interactive platform for friends in the academic and industrial fields related to Wi-Fi, to jointly promote valuable and influential Wi-Fi research into industrial applications, and to drive the next decade of development in the Wi-Fi industry.</p>\n<h2>Technical Cooperation</h2>\n<p>We are very eager to engage in extensive contacts with various Wi-Fi vendors and discuss how to promote the application and large-scale implementation of Wi-Fi ISAC through the enhancement of underlying hardware capabilities.</p>\n<p>For technical cooperation, please contact: <a href=\"mailto:zpj@xidian.edu.cn\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">zpj@xidian.edu.cn</a></p>\n",

The supported COTS NIC models include Intel Wi-Fi 6E AX210 (<strong>AX210</strong>), Intel Wi-Fi 6 AX200 (<strong>AX200</strong>), Qualcomm Atheros AR9300 (<strong>QCA9300</strong>), and the legendary Intel Wireless Link 5300 (<strong>IWL5300</strong>). The supported SDR devices include the HackRF One and <em>all</em> models of <strong>USRP</strong> devices.</p>\n<p>For COTS Wi-Fi NICs, PicoScenes provides many exclusive hardware features:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>With AX210/AX200 NIC, PicoScenes is the first and currently the only publicly available platform that enables <strong>CSI extraction for 802.11ax-format</strong> frames using commodity Wi-Fi hardware. It supports CSI extraction for <strong>all Wi-Fi formats (802.11a/g/n/ac/ax)</strong> and <strong>up to 160 MHz bandwidth</strong>. Additionally, PicoScenes enables <strong>CSI measurement for all overheard frames in monitor mode</strong>, utilizing the surrounding Wi-Fi devices as excitation signals for ISAC research &amp; applications.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With AX210 NIC, PicoScenes is the first and currently the only publicly available platform that enables packet injection and <strong>CSI measurement in the Wi-Fi 6 GHz band</strong> using the AX210 NIC. It unlocks <strong>a total of 1.18 GHz</strong> spectrum from 5945 MHz to 7125 MHz, providing researchers worldwide with continuous spectrum availability for Wi-Fi ISAC research. The AX210 NIC, as the next-generation of AX200, is the only Wi-Fi 6E NIC ready for Wi-Fi ISAC, marking the entrance of Wi-Fi ISAC into the Wi-Fi 6E era.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With QCA9300 NIC, PicoScenes offers <strong>arbitrary tuning for both carrier frequency and baseband sampling rate</strong>, providing a total of <strong>2.4 GHz-wide spectrum</strong> availability and <strong>2.5 to 80 MHz bandwidth</strong>. It also includes <strong>manual Rx gain control</strong> ranging from 0 to 66 dB. The platform supports QCA9300 to IWL5300 CSI measurement, as well as Tx/Rx radio-chain control and transmission of <strong>extra spatial sounding</strong> LTFs (HT-ELTFs).</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>For SDR, PicoScenes is currently the <em>only</em> platform that can transform a SDR device into a SDR-based Wi-Fi NIC, <em>i.e.</em>, <strong>transmitting/receiving Wi-Fi frames and measuring their CSI in real time just like a full-functional Wi-Fi NIC</strong>. It has four major highlights: full protocol compliance, rich PHY-layer control, complete and all-stage PHY-layer information, and high performance.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Full Protocol Compliance up to Wi-Fi 7</strong>: PicoScenes Wi-Fi baseband supports transmitting and receiving Wi-Fi frames in all formats, including 802.11a/g/n/ac/<strong>ax/be</strong>, and across all bandwidths (20/40/80/<strong>160/320 MHz</strong>). It also supports all coding schemes (LDPC and BCC), <em>all modulation and coding schemes (MCS 0 to 13)</em>, and <em>up to 4x4 MIMO</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Rich PHY-Layer Control</strong>: PicoScenes <strong>grants users extensive control over the transmission and reception process</strong>. Users can operate in non-standard carrier frequencies and bandwidths, manually specify carrier frequency offset (CFO), sampling frequency offset (SFO), symbol timing offset (STO), I/Q mismatching, resampling, and various OFDM encoding/decoding settings. PicoScenes is the first platform to provide <em>signal precoding/steering capabilities</em>, allowing users to implement beamforming, phased array, or arbitrary Tx equalization. For example, users can specify antenna positions and desired angles of departure (AoD) for phased array applications, and PicoScenes will calculate the steering matrix and apply it to the spatial mapping mechanism of 802.11n/ac/ax/be.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>Complete and All-Stage PHY-Layer Information</strong>: PicoScenes provides users with comprehensive information about the PHY layer. This includes not only the <em>raw I/Q streams</em> but also all the staged information produced during the OFDM demodulation process. This information includes CSI computed by L-LTF (<em>Legacy CSI</em>), CSI computed by HT/VHT/HE/EHT-LTF (<em>HT/VHT/HE/EHT-CSI</em>), <em>CFO/SFO estimation</em>, and low-level <em>per-packet baseband signals</em>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><strong>High Performance</strong>: PicoScenes is designed to support real-time Wi-Fi ISAC research with high performance. It can achieve up to 1 kHz CSI measurement at a 20 MHz bandwidth (single thread), support <em>multi-thread RX decoding</em>, and achieve packet injection rates of up to 4 kHz in real-time mode and up to 40 kHz in <em>signal-replay mode</em>. For timing-tolerant research, PicoScenes offers signal record and replay functionalities for both Tx and Rx I/Q streams, enabling users to capture signals and decode frames without packet loss. PicoScenes also provides a <em>Virtual SDR mode</em>, allowing users to generate, manipulate, and test Wi-Fi baseband signals without connecting to an actual SDR device.</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Software Side</h3>\n<p>PicoScenes is far beyond a simple CSI data logger but a versatile Wi-Fi ISAC research platform. As far as we know, It is the first and currently the only platform that supports <strong>multi-NIC concurrent CSI measurement</strong>, which significantly simplifies the array-based CSI measurement. Besides that, it also features the live CSI plot, various low-level controls, and <strong>packet injection in all-format and all-bandwidth</strong>, which promises a fixed-rate CSI measurement.</p>\n<p>As a Wi-Fi ISAC research middleware, PicoScenes encapsulates the per-NIC low-level hardware controls into a set of unified APIs and exposes them to the upper-level plugin layer. Through the PicoScenes plugin mechanism, <strong>complex and interactive CSI measurement tasks can be easily prototyped in a mission-focus manner</strong>. We demonstrate this advantage by <em>EchoProbe</em>, a PicoScenes plugin, which provides <em>ms</em>-grade round-trip CSI measurement, large spectrum scanning and the most basic CSI data logging capabilities.</p>\n<p>PicoScenes MATLAB Toolbox (PMT) is the MATLAB parsing routine for the <em>.csi</em> file generated by the PicoScenes. The parsing can be as easy as just <strong>dragging the .csi files into MATLAB</strong>. The fundamental data structure is in versioned-segment format, which guarantees forward compatibility across the future upgrade.</p>\n<p>The PicoScenes software ecosystem (customized driver, platform, and plugins) is <strong>built against the latest kernel, packaged in the Debian .deb format, and auto-updated via the easy</strong> <em>apt upgrade</em> <strong>command</strong>. A fresh-new installation can be as short as 10 minutes. Setting up a CSI-measurement environment can never be such easy!</p>\n<p>You may refer to <a href=\"/my-docs/userManual/features_pricing.html\" target=\"_blank\">Features &amp; License</a> to learn all the features of PicoScenes platform. We hope you enjoy the next ride of Wi-Fi ISAC research, supercharged by PicoScenes!</p>\n",
